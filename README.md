# Movies-ETL
Module 8 exploration of ETL using Python/Pandas to extract/transform data from .csv &amp; .json and load to SQL DB.

It is poor Git repository practice to upload raw datasets.  Instead of uploading raw datasets used for this module, here are the links to obtain:
- Download link for zipped Kaggle dataset:  
  - https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download
- Download link for wikipedia movies .json dataset:  
  - https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_8/wikipedia-movies.json
